User stories I have completed:

- As a volunteer, I need to be able to see what sessions are available to sign up to volunteer
- As a volunteer, I need to be able to see what sessions I have signed up for
- As a volunteer, I need to be able to claim an available session
- As a volunteer, I need to be able to cancel a session I have already signed up for

User stories I would like to complete:

- As a manager, I need to be able to see if any sessions don't have a volunteer signed up
- As a manager, I need to be abel to see the name, email, and phone number of the person who signed up to any session
